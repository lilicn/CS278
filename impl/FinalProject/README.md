Final Project
=============

Overview
--------
The final project will be a team project. You must have 2-4 team members for your project. You are free to build any piece of software that you choose as long as it meets the requirements listed below. You may use the language of your choice.

Key Dates
---------
Project Ideas Presented: 11/5

User Stories Complete: 11/12

v1.0 Demo in Class: 11/21

Final Demo and Presentation: 12/5

Overview of Deliverables
-------------------------
For the project ideas deliverable, you must bring 3 project ideas to class and be prepared to present them (no slides are required -- but you can create them if you want). Once you have formed a team, you will use Pivotal Tracker to create a set of requirements for your project in the form of "user stories" (see Intro_to_Agile_Methods in the course reading materials). We will go over the user stories in class and you must justify that they demonstrate sufficient complexity for a group-based final project. The last class before Thanksgiving, you will present a 1.0 demo of your project. You will demo the final version of the project in class on 12/5. All steps, including the 1.0 demo, count towards the project grade.

The final version of the code must be checked into a public GitHub repo before class on 12/5. You should send an email to the TA with a link to the repo.
