======
You can choose any interesting framework (e.g., Guava, etc.) or platform (Node.js, Android, etc.) 
that you want for the assignment. The only requirement is that you have a good explanation of why 
that framework is interesting / useful. 

Overview: 
---------
This assignment will help you to learn to build UML diagrams of complex code bases. 
For this assignment, you must download (or simply view online) one of the following code bases:

1.	Android code base (http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html)
2.	Spring Framework (https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework)
3.	Guice (http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/source/)
4.	Guava (https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/source/checkout)
5.	Another complex framework that you have pre-approved by emailing the instructor

Your assignment is to then create UML Class and Sequence diagrams of the architecture of one core 
component of the code base, such as the Android ApplicationManager or Spring dependency injection framework.
